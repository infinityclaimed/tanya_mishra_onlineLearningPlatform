                        <p>Defining the key problematic areas with online language learning platforms were crucial in the making of Archizo. <br> <br> The common consesus agreed on the following facts: <br> 1. The concept of "Free PDFs" is obsolete and overwhelming as they lack structure and relevant information. <br> 2. Many video libraries offer a narrow selection of content that is often irrelevant to the learner's needs. <br> 3. Several platforms often prioritise simple phrases, neglecting the importance of grammar for advanced language skills. <br> <br> Taking these into account, we came up with ARCHIZO; which is the Greek term for "START". Our aim is to provide comprehensive free resources so as to unlock the unlimited learning potential of our learners. Our exhaustive library of authentic audio and text materials, including news articles, literature and music aims to allow users to dive into the heart of the languages. Our level tests give learners a chance to test their previous understanding of the language, wherein the algorithm recommends them the best pathway for the best learning experience. <br> <br> All in goal, ARCHIZO'S ultimate goal is to provide a holistic environment for enthusiasts to integrate fluency, an appreciable understanding of the culture and make them industry ready.   </p>
